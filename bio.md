## Languages

* I'm fluent in the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language. I've written many documents with LaTeX, including a [book](http://www.editions-ellipses.fr/product_info.php?products_id=7159) and my PhD thesis. I built this website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using [this article](http://www.njtierney.com/jekyll/2015/11/11/how-i-built-my-site/). I master googling and copy-pasting from [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and I'm frustration-resistant. Besides, I'm fond of data-surfing.

* My mother tongue is French. I've learnt Spanish. I've learnt Italian too but don't practice much so I mostly only understand it. I'm currently learning Catalan. I also speak English, German, Swedish and I know a bit of Dutch.  

## Personal

I like running and other sports that don't challenge my coordination too much. Running makes me red and happy.

My [spouse](http://dacornu.github.io/) and I would define ourselves as feminists but somehow ended up taking (and enjoying!) salsa lessons here in Barcelona, which gives us very traditional roles.
