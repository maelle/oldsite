Do you remember [my post analysing the music of Les Mills Body Pump with Spotify data](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/10/01/bodypump/)? I thought the API did not return features by song, but it actually does, thanks ≈Åukasz Prokulski for telling me in the comments! You can actually read this commenter's post in Polish using Spotify data [here](http://prokulski.net/index.php/2017/03/01/jesienna-deprecha/).
