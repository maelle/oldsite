Hej! 

<img src="/assets/maelle.JPG" alt="maelle" width="300">

Welcome on my website, where I'll showcase my work and some data analysis/R.

My last name is Salmon like the fish, and my first name, Maëlle, is derived from a Celtic word that means princess or chief. It's pronounced "Ma-El" as "ma" in "macaroni" and as the Spanish "El". The accent on the e in ë doesn't change the pronounciation, so I guess it's my crown.

I'm a statistician working in an epidemiological research center but I also have a background in biology/ecology. Science took me places in Europe. Currently, I live and work in Barcelona, Spain. I like open-source, open data, open science, and I work in an open space surrounded by nice colleagues.

I made this map with [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).
