I couldn't miss the fun Twitter hashtag [#BadStockPhotosOfMyJob](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BadStockPhotosOfMyJob?src=hash) thanks to a [tweet by Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge/status/992952211201130497)  and [another one by Colin Fay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/993055416266436608). The latter inspired me to actually go and look for what makes a data science photo... What characterizes "data science" stock photos?

# My (not bad) stock photo source

## Pexels metadata for the win

Where to find information related to stock photos? In [two](http://www.masalmon.eu/2018/01/04/bubblegumpuppies/) [previous](http://www.masalmon.eu/2018/01/07/rainbowing/) blog posts of mine I used Pexels, a website providing CC0 pictures which is quite nice. My goal was to obtain the titles and the tags of stock photos of "data science": for instance if you look at [this picture](https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-laptop-beside-black-computer-mouse-inside-room-669996/), its tags are "business", "contemporary", "computer", etc. Pexels tags are very useful metadata, saving me the effort to use machine learning methods to analyse images.

## Responsible webscraping

When researching this post I discovered that Pexels has an API, documented [here](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/) but this API does not get you the title nor the tags associated to a picture so only webscraping could get me what I needed.

Webscraping is a powerful tool allowing one to [rectangle](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/data-rectangling) webpages but with great power comes great responsability. Being _able_ to scrape a webpage does not mean you are _allowed_ to. You could get sued or your IP could get blocked. I am far from being an expert but I often read [Bob Rudis' blog](https://rud.is/b/) where I learnt about rOpenSci's [`robotstxt` package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/robotstxt) that does "robots.txt file parsing and checking for R" which in plain language means it checks for you what a webpage legally allows you to do. See below, 


```r
# how I'll find pictures
robotstxt::paths_allowed("https://www.pexels.com/search")
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
# where tags live
robotstxt::paths_allowed("https://www.pexels.com/photo")
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

robots.txt files often also tell you how often you can hit a page by defining a "crawling delay". Sadly Pexels robots.txt doesn't:


```r
robotstxt::get_robotstxt("https://www.pexels.com")
```

```
## Sitemap: https://s3.amazonaws.com/pexels/sitemaps/sitemap.xml.gz
```

But Bob Rudis, who was patient and nice enough to answer my questions, told me that I should probably respect the rate limit defined in [Pexels API docs](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/). "Do not abuse the API. The API is rate-limited to 200 requests per hour and 20,000 requests per month." As I recently explained in [a post on Locke Data's blog](https://itsalocke.com/blog/some-web-api-package-development-lessons-from-hibpwned/), these days to limit rate of a function I use [the very handy `ratelimitr` package](https://github.com/tarakc02/ratelimitr) by [Tarak Shah](https://tarakc02.github.io/).


```r
limited_get <- ratelimitr::limit_rate(httr::GET,
                                      ratelimitr::rate(200, 60*60),# not more than 200 times an hour
                                      ratelimitr::rate(1, 5))#not more than 1 time every 5 seconds
```

## Elegant webscraping

At the time of the two aforelinked blog posts I had used [`RSelenium`](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium) to scroll down and get the download link of many pictures, but Bob Rudis wrote [an elegant and cool alternative](https://gist.github.com/hrbrmstr/4cabe4af87bd2c5fe664b0b44a574366) using query parameters, on which I'll build in this post. 

I first re-wrote the function to get all 15 pictures of each page of results.

```r
get_page <- function(num = 1, seed = 1) {
  message(num)
  limited_get(
    url = "https://www.pexels.com/search/data science/",
    query = list(
      page=num,
      seed=seed
    )
  ) -> res
  
  httr::stop_for_status(res)
  
  pg <- httr::content(res)
  
  tibble::tibble(
    url = rvest::html_attr(rvest::html_nodes(pg, xpath = "//a[@class='js-photo-link']"), "href"),
    title = rvest::html_attr(rvest::html_nodes(pg, xpath = "//a[@class='js-photo-link']"), "title"),
    tags = purrr::map(url, get_tags)
  )
  
} 

```

I re-wrote it because I needed the "href" and because it seems that the structure of each page changed a bit since the day on which the gist was written. To find out I had to write "a[@class='js-photo-link']" I inspected the source of a page.

Then I wrote a function getting tags for each picture.

```r
get_tags <- function(url){
  message(url)
  url <- paste0("https://www.pexels.com", url)
  res <- limited_get(url)
  httr::stop_for_status(res)
  pg <- httr::content(res)
  nodes <- rvest::html_nodes(pg, xpath = '//a[@data-track-label="tag" ]')
  rvest::html_text(nodes)
}
```
And finally I got results for 20 pages. I chose 20 without thinking too much. It seemed enough for my needs, and each of these pages had pictures.

```r
ds_stock <- purrr::map_df(1:20, get_page)
ds_stock <- unique(ds_stock)
ds_stock <- tidyr::unnest(ds_stock, tags)
```



I got 300 unique pictures.

# What's in a data science stock photo?

Now that I have all this information at hand, I can describe data science stock photos!

## Data science tags


```r
library("ggplot2")
library("ggalt")
library("hrbrthemes")
tag_counts <- dplyr::count(ds_stock, tags, sort = TRUE)[1:10,]

dplyr::mutate(tag_counts,
              tags = reorder(tags, n)) %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_lollipop(aes(tags, n),
                size = 2, col = "salmon") +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16) +
  xlab("Tag") +
  ggtitle("300 data science stock photos",
          subtitle = "Most frequent tags. Source: https://www.pexels.com") +
  coord_flip()
```

So the most common tags are data, technology, business and computer. Not too surprising! 

## Data science scenes

Now, let's have a look at _titles_ that are in general more descriptive of what's happening/present on the photo (i.e. is the computer near a cup of coffee or is someone working on it). I tried using a technique described in [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/)'s and [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/)'s [Tidy text mining book](https://www.tidytextmining.com): "Counting and correlating pairs of words with the `widyr` package" described in [this section of the book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/ngrams.html#counting-and-correlating-pairs-of-words-with-the-widyr-package) but it wasn't too interesting because most correlation values were too low. One issue was probably my having too few titles: only half of pictures have titles! So I'll resort to plotting most common bigrams, which I learnt in the [Tidy text mining book](https://www.tidytextmining.com) as well.



```r
stopwords <- rcorpora::corpora("words/stopwords/en")$stopWords

ds_stock %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(title)) %>%
  dplyr::select(title) %>%
  unique() %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(bigram, title,
                          token = "ngrams", n = 2)  %>%
  tidyr::separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ",
                  remove = FALSE)  %>%
  dplyr::filter(!word1 %in% stopwords) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!word2 %in% stopwords)%>%
  dplyr::count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(bigram = reorder(bigram, n)) %>%
  head(n = 10)%>%
ggplot() +
  geom_lollipop(aes(bigram, n),
                size = 2, col = "salmon") +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16) +
  ggtitle("300 data science stock photos",
          subtitle = "Most frequent bigrams in titles. Source: https://www.pexels.com")+
  coord_flip()
```

So there's a lot of holding computer happening, and these laptops are either black or white... And well Macbook Pro probably looks more professional?

# Hold my laptop and watch...

my trying to find a good post conclusion! In this post, I tried to responsibly and elegantly scrape rich photo metadata from Pexels to characterize stock photos of data science. Using tags, and most common bigrams in titles, I found that data science stock photos are associated with data, business and computers; and that they often show people holding computers. Now, you'll excuse me while I try and comfort my poor pink laptop that feels a bit too un-data-sciency.
